Title,Find the syntax error in signal assignment
QuestionText,"The signal assignment below appears in the VHDL description of a
    circuit. The assignment is flagged as having a syntax error. Which of the
    following could be wrong with the signal assignment? Select all that could be
    wrong. Recall that a syntax error is a violation of the rules of a language,
    not a logical bug.
